# Ant Colony Simulation

An ant colony simulation developed by Kevin Silvares on Godot Game Engine for educational and research purposes.

## Introduction

This is an experimental project focused on the progressive development of a virtual ant colony. Its main objective is to serve as a learning environment for designing and implementing complex simulation systems from scratch.

## Goals

The objective is to design and implement multiple small, self-contained simulation systems (such as food gathering, pheromones and population control...) that will gradually interconnect to mimic the behavior of a real ant colony.

## Disclaimer

I am by no means an entomologist or an expert in ant behavior. **All simulated behaviors are based on information gathered from books, articles and other online resources, and may not accurately represent real world ant colonies.**

Additionally, since ant species differ significantly, **the behaviors represented here are generalized and not tied to any specific species.**
